### Day 1 Journal
> I have decided to participate in the 100 days of code challenge using Python. This is thanks to inspiration encouragement from my friend Chirstopher Tettey. He started the challenge and we have some conversation about it and I was convinced to join in on the fun. Although, I don't use Python in my day to day programming, I am not new to it and I have led some labs and trainings on Python, so why am I starting this challenge as a beginner? I don't want to skip the fundamentals :) and I hope by sharing the journey here, at least one person will be encouraged to learn Python and make a decision to commit to learning it for 100 days. Let's have fun together :)

> Day 1: This was challenging...I had to consciously resist the urge to skip the videos. After conquering that urge, it was fun.
