### Day Journal
> I have decided to participate in the 100 days of code challenge using Python. This is thanks to inspiration encouragement from my friend Chirstopher Tettey. He started the challenge and we have some conversation about it and I was convinced to join in on the fun activity. Although, I don't use Python in my day to day programming, I am not new to it and I have led some labs and trainings on Python, so why am I starting this challenge as a beginner? I don't want to skip the fundamentals :) and I hope by sharing the journey here, at least one person will be encouraged to learn Python and make a decision to commit to learning it for 100 days. Let's have fun together :) [click here to start](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)

> **Day 1**: This was challenging...I had to consciously resist the urge to skip the videos. After conquering that urge, it was fun.

> **Day 2**: I took a break to attend to more pressing items but I am back at it agian and this time, I will be consistent

> **Day 3**: I completed day 3 & 4 videos and challenges

> **Day 4**: completed Day 5 video and challenge. I learnt some new methods of random that i had not previously used. This was one of the challenges I have enjoyed so far

> **Day 5**: completed videos and challenge for Day 6. Very interesting using [Reeborg's world](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) and getting though the maze.

>**Musings**: When you're training beginners in python, do you just tell them this is *print* and this is how we use it or explain what a function is at the early stages and later dive deeper into user defined functions?

> **Day 6**: Completed the hangman challenge. This was a guided challenge like the other but different since all section worked on the challenge and also  applied already learnt concepts. This is a great way for retaining knowledge. Most courses in the universities or short courses should adopt this. It makes it more interesting working on something enjoyable while apply knowledge acquired
